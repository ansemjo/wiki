# ansemjo/wiki

This ~~is~~ was a small personal wiki built from static
Markdown-formatted files with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

It is now merged into my homepage repository [ansemjo/homepage](https://github.com/ansemjo/homepage),
which is a static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Old links *should* continue to work becuase I've added permanent
redirect rules to my webserver for all relevant paths, see `nginx-redirects.conf`.
