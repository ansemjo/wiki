Network Booting Combined DHCP responses Last time I changed my PXE procedure to use custom iPXE scripts and compiled iPXE binaries, I ran into the problem that the bootloop needs to be broken somehow, if you specify the iPXE binary as the boot target via DHCP and do not want to recompile your binary with new scripts embedded every time. This assumed dumb DHCP servers, which cannot react to different client classes. And while OpenWRT and the underlying dnsmasq are not exactly dumb , the necessary settings are not comfortably exposed in Luci. So I used an unused DHCP option to specify the real PXE boot target and an embedded iPXE script which reads this option and then chainloads. Whew! Today I learned that clients can assemble responses from multiple DHCP servers and dnsmasq can act as a proxy just fine, meaning it will only serve the settings relevant to PXE booting and leave all the IP assignments, DNS settings, etc. to the main DHCP server in the network. Yay! This means that the same server that shall act as the target for PXE booting (possibly even containing a gRPC-enabled matchbox ) can also serve the relevant DHCP settings so clients will use it. CoreOS containers The CoreOS team provides containers for both matchbox and dnsmasq : quay.io/coreos/matchbox quay.io/coreos/dnsmasq Together with the sample systemd service files provided in matchbox releases in the contrib/systemd/ subdirectory, these can easily be used to bootstrap a fully functional network boot target on top of CoreOS.

Then install to disk with coreos-install : curl -Lo install.json https://ks.surge.sh/matchbox.json sudo coreos-install -d /dev/sda -i install.json sudo reboot Append -o vmware_raw to the installation command if you're installing on VMware and replace /dev/sda with /dev/vda if you're installing on KVM (or use scsi-virtio disks). Reboot twice for the autologin to take effect. Then add this matchbox server in your DNS. Install CentOS over Serial Cable Simply using netboot.xyz.kpxe is not sufficient when installing from network with only a serial connection (e.g. on my X10SBA) because it does not allow you to edit the kernel commandline - which does not include console=ttyS0 by default. Thus boot into an iPXE shell and use the following script to start an interactive CentOS install over serial: imgfree set repo http://mirror.23media.de/centos/7/os/x86_64 kernel ${ repo } /images/pxeboot/vmlinuz initrd ${ repo } /images/pxeboot/initrd.img imgargs vmlinuz ramdisk_size=8192 console=ttyS0,115200 text method= ${ repo } / boot Careful when copy-pasting though. I have had incomplete pastes which lead to a missing _64 in the repo URL, etc. Squid proxy Instead of mirroring multiple repositories locally, you could run a Squid proxy in your network and point all yum clients at it. With some URL rewriting you can cache the same packages from many different mirrors in a deduplicated fashion. I used the sameersbn/squid image on a CoreOS host, started with the following arguments: docker run -d --net host --name squid \\ -v /var/spool/squid:/var/spool/squid \\ -v /etc/squid:/etc/squid sameersbn/squid The configuration files cache all .rpm 's from any mirrors.

Finally, simply add proxy=http://url.to.your.proxy:3128 in your clients' /etc/yum.conf . reverse proxy With a small addition to your squid.conf you can also make Squid act as a reverse proxy (or \"accelerator\" in Squid terms) for a mirror of your choice, using the same cache .

Since access to the Docker socket is equivalent to being root ( or worse ) we must preferably run the engine on a seperate machine. Long story short: virtualization with QEMU/KVM provides all the required isolation and CoreOS is easy to deploy and bundles Docker by default. The following steps are designed for a CentOS 7.6 hypervisor. Prerequisites First of all, we need to prepare our hypervisor, so install QEMU and libvirt. yum install qemu-kvm libvirt modprobe kvm systemctl enable --now libvirtd Info We are going to use virt-install as well, however the version in EPEL is not recent enough to use the kernel= and initrd= arguments with --location . Thus prefer a local manager and append --connect qemu+ssh://root@hypervisor/system to virsh or virt-install commands. Boot a Virtual Machine There is a guide on how to boot CoreOS with libvirt but I prefer to perform a clean installation to disk. Therefore we need to boot CoreOS to RAM and deploy using an Ignition configuration. Via Text Console If you don't want to bother with VNC connections and would prefer to install via a text console on the hypervisor itself, you can download and run the CoreOS vmlinuz and cpio.gz directly: virt-install --name runner --memory 4096 --vcpus 4 \\ --disk size = 20 ,bus = virtio --hvm --rng /dev/urandom \\ --autostart --nographics --console pty,target_type = virtio \\ --location \"https://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/,kernel=coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz,initrd=coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz\" \\ --extra-args \"coreos.autologin console=ttyS0\" \\ --os-variant virtio26 Note Remember to append a --connect string if you are connecting to a remote libvirt socket. If you prefer to download and verify an ISO locally instead, you can substitute: --location /tmp/coreos.iso,kernel=/coreos/vmlinuz,initrd=/coreos/cpio.gz \\ Hint You can find files inside an ISO with isoinfo -Jf -i /path/to/iso . Via VNC Viewer Apart from using VNC, we are going to use netboot.xyt in this approach. This is possible with virt-install version 1.5.0 on CentOS 7. First, download the netboot image: cd /var/lib/libvirt/boot curl -LO https://boot.netboot.xyz/ipxe/netboot.xyz.iso Now create the virtual machine with virt-install : virt-install --name runner --memory 4096 --vcpus 4 \\ --disk size=20,bus=virtio --hvm --rng /dev/urandom \\ --autostart --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/boot/netboot.xyz.iso \\ --graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 --noautoconsole \\ --os-variant virtio26 This should start the installation process and enable a VNC console. You can check the port with virsh vncdisplay runner and verify with ss -tln . In my case :0 corresponds to port 5900 on the host, so temporarily open that port in the firewall: firewall-cmd --add-port 5900/tcp Connect with your favourite VNC client and complete the installation. Hint You can't currently change the keyboard map on the console. Set a password with sudo passwd core and connect with ssh instead if you run into problems. Install CoreOS to Disk Prepare Ignition By now you should have prepared an Ignition configuration. There is of course a lot of variation possible here but most importantly you should enable rngd.service and docker.service and make sure that you can connect with SSH public keys. Mine looks somewhat like this: --- # enable docker service systemd : units : - name : rngd.service enabled : yes - name : docker.service enabled : yes # ssh public keys passwd : users : - name : core ssh_authorized_keys : - # add your keys here # automatic updates during maintenance window locksmith : reboot_strategy : reboot window_start : 04:00 window_length : 3h # enable console autologin storage : filesystems : - name : OEM mount : device : /dev/disk/by-label/OEM format : ext4 files : - filesystem : OEM path : /grub.cfg mode : 0644 append : true contents : inline : | set linux_append=\"$linux_append coreos.autologin\" Installation After transpiling, I am using surge.sh to host small static files quickly. Download the configuration and finally install CoreOS to disk: curl -LO \"https://ks.surge.sh/coreos/docker.json\" sudo coreos-install -d /dev/vda -i docker.json sudo udevadm settle sudo reboot Miscellaneous Fixed DHCP Address You can add a fixed address for this virtual machine by creating an IP assignment for its MAC address with virsh : virsh net-dhcp-leases default # see current leases virsh net-update default add-last ip-dhcp-host \\ --xml \"<host mac='52:54:00:e7:b6:4d' ip='192.168.122.2' />\" \\ --live --config SSH Client Configuration Add an appropriate SSH config on the hypervisor: Host runner User core HostName 192.168.122.2 StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null","title":"Docker in QEMU/KVM"},{"location":"rechenzentrum/docker-in-kvm.html#docker-in-qemukvm","text":"Some applications may require a properly isolated Docker engine where users of the API have every freedom but when they must not be able to compromise the host security.
